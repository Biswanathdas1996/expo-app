# English Level API Integration Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated the English Level API endpoint into the Expo React Native app. The integration allows users to update their English proficiency level during the onboarding process.

## API Endpoint Integrated

```
PUT /api/user/english-level
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated API Constants (`app/constants/Api.ts`)

- Added new `USER` endpoint group
- Added `ENGLISH_LEVEL: "/api/user/english-level"` endpoint

### 2. Added API Types (`app/types/api.ts`)

- `EnglishLevelUpdateRequest` interface
- `EnglishLevelUpdateResponse` interface

### 3. Enhanced API Service (`app/services/apiService.ts`)

- Added `updateEnglishLevel(englishLevel: string)` method
- Handles authentication automatically using stored session data
- Includes proper error handling and logging
- Returns structured response with success/failure status

### 4. Updated Onboarding Hook (`app/hooks/useOnboarding.ts`)

- Modified `handleNext()` to call API when moving from level selection
- Added `isLoading` state to manage UI during API calls
- Integrated with existing authentication system

### 5. Enhanced Level Selection Component (`app/components/screens/LevelSelectionComponent.tsx`)

- Added `isLoading` prop to interface
- Updated button to show "Updating..." when API call in progress
- Disabled interactions during API call

### 6. Updated Usage Points

- **Main Tab (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`)**: Added `isLoading` prop from hook
- **Navigation (`app/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`)**: Integrated API call in navigation flow

## How It Works

1. **User selects English level** in the LevelSelectionComponent
2. **User clicks "Continue"**
3. **API call is triggered** with the selected level
4. **UI shows loading state** ("Updating..." button, disabled interactions)
5. **API updates user profile** on the server
6. **Navigation proceeds** to next step after successful update
7. **Error handling** logs failures but doesn't block user flow

## Request Format

```json
{
  "sessionId": "user_session_id_from_storage",
  "englishLevel": "intermediate" // lowercase level name
}
```

## Authentication

- Uses existing authentication system
- Automatically retrieves `sessionId` from stored user session
- Includes Bearer token in Authorization header
- Handles authentication errors gracefully

## Error Handling

- Network errors are caught and logged
- Authentication errors are handled
- User flow continues even if API call fails
- Loading states prevent double-submissions

## Testing

- Created test script (`test-api.js`) to verify endpoint connectivity
- Confirmed API responds correctly (401 with test token as expected)
- No TypeScript errors in any updated files

## Benefits

- Seamless user experience with loading feedback
- Robust error handling that doesn't break user flow
- Proper authentication integration
- Consistent with existing app architecture
- Ready for production use

The integration is now complete and ready for testing with real user authentication!
