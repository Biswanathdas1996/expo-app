# User Profile Integration Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented user profile functionality with API integration after membership completion. Here's what was implemented:

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### 1. User Profile Component (`UserProfileComponent.tsx`)

- **Location**: `app/components/screens/UserProfileComponent.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Display user profile information (name, age, gender, country, etc.)

  - Display membership information with status indicators
  - Refresh functionality (pull-to-refresh)
  - Error handling with retry options
  - Loading states
  - Profile photo display support

### 2. API Integration

- **New Method**: `getUserProfileWithMemberships()` in `ApiService`
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/user/profile-with-memberships`
- **Authentication**: Uses existing auth token system

### 3. Navigation Integration

- **Profile Tab**: Updated the existing "explore" tab to be a "Profile" tab
- **Auto-redirect**: After successful membership submission, users are automatically redirected to the profile page
- **Uses Expo Router**: Leverages `router.push('/(tabs)/explore')` for navigation

## üîÑ User Flow

1. User completes onboarding flow
2. User opens Benefits Modal and fills out Membership Form
3. Upon successful membership submission:
   - Success alert is shown
   - User is automatically redirected to Profile tab
   - Profile page loads user data via API call
4. Profile page displays:
   - User's personal information
   - English skill levels
   - Membership status and details
   - Refresh functionality for updated data

## üìÅ Files Modified

1. **New Files**:

   - `app/components/screens/UserProfileComponent.tsx`

2. **Modified Files**:
   - `app/services/apiService.ts` - Added profile API method
   - `app/components/modals/MembershipFormModal.tsx` - Added success callback
   - `app/components/modals/BenefitsModal.tsx` - Added navigation logic
   - `app/(tabs)/explore.tsx` - Changed to profile screen
   - `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Updated tab icon and title
   - `app/components/index.ts` - Exported new component

- Graceful handling of missing data

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Authentication

- Uses existing `AuthService.getAuthHeaders()` for API authentication
- Integrates with current session management
- Handles auth errors gracefully

### State Management

- Local state for profile data and loading states
- Proper error state management
- Refresh control for data updates

### Type Safety

- Full TypeScript implementation
- Proper interface definitions for user profile and membership data
- Type-safe navigation with Expo Router

## üåê API Integration

The profile component calls the following API endpoint:

```
GET /api/user/profile-with-memberships
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

Expected response structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "profile": {
      "id": "string",
      "name": "string",
      "email": "string",
      "age": number,
      "gender": "string",
      "country": "string",
      "mobileNumber": "string",
      "whatsappNumber": "string",
      "englishSkills": ["string"],
      "highestQualification": "string",
      "speakingPartnerInterest": "string",
      "aboutYou": "string",
      "profilePhotoBase64": "string"
    },
    "memberships": [
      {
        "id": "string",
        "membershipType": "string",
        "status": "string",
        "startDate": "string",
        "endDate": "string",
        "features": ["string"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## ‚úÖ Testing

- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Expo development server starts successfully
- Components are properly exported and imported
- Navigation flow works correctly

The implementation provides a complete user profile experience with seamless integration into the existing app architecture.
